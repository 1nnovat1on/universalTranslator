# requirements.txt

# User-specified core dependencies
googletrans==3.1.0a0
langdetect==1.0.9
SpeechRecognition==3.8.1
pyttsx3==2.90

# Flask and web server related dependencies
Flask>=2.0 # Using >= to get recent stable versions, pin if needed (e.g., Flask==2.3.2)
Flask-Cors>=3.0 # For handling requests from Squarespace/browser
pydub>=0.25 # For audio format conversion

# Optional but recommended for production deployment
gunicorn # WSGI server for Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS)
# waitress # WSGI server for Windows systems

# Note: googletrans can sometimes be unreliable as it relies on unofficial APIs.
# Consider alternatives like google-cloud-translate if stability is paramount.

# Note: pyttsx3 is included as requested, but it's NOT used for speaking
# audio back to the user in the web version (browser's SpeechSynthesis is used).
# It would only be needed if generating audio files *on the server*.
